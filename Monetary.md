🔐 Monetary & Privacy Architecture — Economy of Truth

🧭 Goal

Build a transparent economy where:

Users can anonymously submit revelations.

The protocol automatically rewards verified truth through a secure and fair system.

XMR (Monero) ensures whistleblower anonymity.

A native token handles DAO governance, staking, and voting.

🔒 Privacy & Security

✅ For Whistleblowers

Access only via Tor or Tails.

No JavaScript frontend (HTML static / precompiled Svelte).

Anonymous account creation with:

Encrypted password

2FA (TOTP) support

Airgap recovery codes option


Deposits made only in XMR:

Untraceable (ring signatures)

Unlinkable (stealth addresses)

Hidden history (default Monero privacy features)



✅ For Rewards

Once a DAO confirms the report, a reward is converted to XMR internally.

Withdrawal is done via secured interface (WebAuthn or 2FA required).

The user chooses to:

Withdraw anonymously in Monero.

Or reinvest in DAO activities (staking / voting / bounties).




---

🪙 Native Token (TRUTH, EOT, or PoT)

Type: ERC-20 or compatible (e.g. Arbitrum, ZkSync, Base)

Used for:

Staking to post revelations

Voting weight in thematic DAOs

Validator reputation score


Not publicly listed (initially)

Internal XMR <-> Token bridge:

Fully encrypted

Operates without third-party custodians




---

🧠 Additional Notes

XMR vaults are stored in cold wallets or multisig setups to prevent theft.

No public correlation exists between internal token ↔ XMR deposit — all links are ephemeral and encrypted client-side.

Delayed withdrawals can be used to avoid timing-based correlation.



---

🛡️ Compliance & Ethics

The system is designed to protect citizens, not evade justice.

Any manipulation or misinformation attempt is punished:

Token burn

DAO-level banning or loss of reputation


Each transfer is logged on the public token blockchain, but never linked to a real-world identity.
