# 🧠 Overview & Development Plan: **The Economy of Truth**

---

## I. 🎯 Vision & Foundations (Phase 0 – Concept & Code Base)

### 🔹 Core Objectives:

- Protect whistleblowers.
- Reward disclosures based on public impact.
- Build an ethical ecosystem centered around truth and verifiability.

### 🔹 System Pillars:

- Privacy by design (Tor, Tails, no IP logging)
- Truth staking (submissions = locked value)
- Rewards based on verified truth + impact
- DAO-based decentralized governance

### 🔹 Recommended Tech Stack:

| Component         | Recommended Technology                        |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Anonymous Frontend | Minimal React + Tor access (Tails-compatible) |
| Backend API       | FastAPI or Flask                              |
| File Storage      | IPFS + Arweave                                |
| Hashing/Traceability | Ethereum L2 (Polygon, Base) or Substrate     |
| Smart Contracts   | Solidity / Ink! (staking, verification)       |
| DAO               | Snapshot / Aragon / custom governance logic   |
| Reputation System | Off-chain + Merkle proofs                     |

## II. 🔐 SECURITY & ANONYMITY (Phase 1)

🎯 **Goal:** Guarantee 100% anonymous access and submission.

### Modules:

1. 🧅 Tor-compatible Web Interface  
2. 📤 Client-side encrypted submission (.zip/.pdf/.mp4 with checksum)  
3. 💾 Upload to IPFS via Tor gateway  
4. 🔏 Local asymmetric key generator for submitters (wallet-independent)

✅ **Delivery:**  
- `secure_submit.py` (Python CLI)  
- `submit.html` (Minimal front-end)

---

## III. 💸 INCENTIVES & STAKING (Phase 2)

🎯 **Goal:** Build an economy where truth = reward and lies = loss.

### Modules:

1. 📎 Submissions require staking TRUTH tokens  
2. 🧪 Decentralized validation → verdict  
3. 📈 Smart contract distributes rewards or burns stake

| Result                | Action                     |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| ✅ Verified info       | Stake returned + Bonus     |
| ⚠️ True but low impact | Stake returned (no bonus)  |
| ❌ False/Misleading     | Stake burned / redistributed |

✅ **Delivery:**  
- `TRUTHStake.sol` (Solidity contract)  
- `stake_submit.html` (Staking interface)

---

## IV. 🧠 DECENTRALIZED VALIDATION (Phase 3)

🎯 **Goal:** Ensure verification through a neutral, transparent process.

### Modules:

1. DAO of validators (reputation-weighted votes)  
2. AI-assisted validation (OCR, timeline, source analysis)  
3. Credibility scoring for submitters (hashed wallets + history)

✅ **Delivery:**  
- `verify_module.py` (AI + scoring logic)  
- DAO via Snapshot + backend integration

---

## V. 🏛️ GOVERNANCE & POOLS (Phase 4)

🎯 **Goal:** Organize community funding around thematic leak categories.

### Modules:

1. Community DAO (create + vote for reward pools)  
2. Pool smart contracts (e.g. Environment, Media, Corruption)  
3. Crowd-staking for specific targets (bounties)

✅ **Delivery:**  
- `governance.html` (React DAO interface)  
- `PoolManager.sol` + `topics.json` (active categories)

---

## VI. 🧬 COLLECTIVE MEMORY & TRACEABILITY (Phase 5)

🎯 **Goal:** Ensure permanent, immutable storage of verified revelations.

### Modules:

1. Permanent storage (IPFS / Arweave)  
2. Unique timestamped hash generation (proof of originality)  
3. Anonymous multi-criteria search system

✅ **Delivery:**  
- `archive_index.py` (SQLite base + search engine)  
- `hash_exporter.py` (blockchain hash validation)

---

## VII. 🚀 TOOLS & CONTRIBUTION SUPPORT (Phase 6)

🎯 **Goal:** Empower contributors to support or participate in submissions.

### Modules:

1. Anonymous wallet generator (CLI tool)  
2. Browser extension for auto-uploading leaks  
3. Email-based listener terminal (PGP-compatible)  
4. “Relay Guardians” system for third-party submissions

✅ **Delivery:**  
- `eot_tools.py` (CLI toolkit)  
- `listener_email_bot.py` (PGP + email module)

---

## VIII. 🧾 WHITEPAPER, LANDING PAGE, LOGO & OUTREACH (Phase 7)

🎯 **Goal:** Present and distribute the project professionally.

### Deliverables:

- Whitepaper (PDF & Markdown, EN/FR)  
- Static landing page hosted via Tor  
- Temporary logo (SVG, minimal design)  
- Messaging framework (claims, signatures)

✅ **Delivery:**  
- `whitepaper.md` + `whitepaper.pdf`  
- `landing_page/index.html`  
- `logo_eot.svg` (or generated via AI tools)

---

## IX. 🔁 MAINTENANCE & EVOLUTION (Ongoing Phase)

🎯 **Goal:** Keep the system censorship-resistant, up-to-date, and extensible.

- Proxy fallback: Tor / I2P / Lokinet  
- Redundant IPFS storage across nodes  
- Optional ENS or Nostr integration  
- Plugin to ingest public leaks (WikiLeaks, DDoSecrets, etc.)
